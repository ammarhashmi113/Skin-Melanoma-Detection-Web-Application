    <!-- Project Description -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>
            Skin cancer, including melanoma, is a significant health concern worldwide. Early detection is crucial for
            improving treatment outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, our goal is to develop a system that enhances the early detection of skin melanoma and
            other types of skin lesions using deep learning and computer vision techniques. Skin melanoma is a type of
            skin cancer that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed and treated promptly. The project aims to provide
            an effective solution for dermatologists, healthcare professionals, and individuals to identify potential
            skin melanoma through an intelligent system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our system employs a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) model designed for skin melanoma detection.
            Users can upload skin images to the web application, which is then fed to the backend CNN model for
            analysis. The model's predictions are presented to users through the web application interface, enabling
            early detection and informed decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
            The significance of this project lies in its potential to aid medical professionals and individuals in
            identifying potential skin melanoma at an early stage, thus improving the chances of successful treatment.
            Early detection can make a substantial difference in patient outcomes. The developed system enhances skin
            melanoma detection by harnessing the power of deep learning and making it accessible to users through a
            user-friendly web application. This project serves as a valuable tool in the ongoing efforts to combat skin
            melanoma effectively.

    <!-- Other Skin Cancer Types -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Other Skin Cancer Types</h2>
        <div class="subsection">
            <p>
                In addition to melanoma, our model is also capable of detecting two other types of skin cancer:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)</li>
                <li>Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) -->
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC)</h3>
            <p>
                BCC is the most prevalent type of skin cancer and often appears on sun-exposed areas like the face,
                neck, and scalp. It typically grows slowly and rarely spreads to other parts of the body.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) -->
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC)</h3>
            <p>
                SCC is another common type of skin cancer that can grow more rapidly than BCC. It tends to develop in
                sun-exposed areas and has a higher chance of spreading if left untreated.
            </p>
        </div>

    <!-- Models Used -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Models Used</h2>
        <p>
            Our skin melanoma detection application utilizes two CNN models and their ensemble model for disease
            prediction:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>ResNet-50</li>
            <li>EfficientNet-B0</li>
            <li>Ensemble Model</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- ResNet-50 -->
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>ResNet-50</h3>
            <p>
                ResNet stands for "Residual Network," and it is a type of convolutional neural network (CNN)
                architecture that was introduced in the paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" by Kaiming
                He et al. in 2015. ResNet-50 is a specific variant of the ResNet architecture that consists of 50
                layers. It has achieved state-of-the-art performance on various image classification benchmarks, such as
                the ImageNet dataset.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- EfficientNet-B0 -->
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>EfficientNet-B0</h3>
            <p>
                EfficientNet is a family of CNN architectures introduced by Mingxing Tan and Quoc V. Le in the paper
                "EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks" in 2019. EfficientNet-B0 is
                the base model in the EfficientNet family. It is designed to provide a good balance between model size
                and accuracy. The "B0" in its name denotes the compound scaling coefficient for this specific variant.
                EfficientNet models have been known for their efficiency in terms of both computational resources and
                model size while achieving competitive performance on image classification tasks.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Ensemble Model -->
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Ensemble Model</h3>
            <p>
                The Ensemble Model in our skin melanoma detection application combines the strengths of EfficientNet-B0
                and ResNet-50, using weighted averaging to create a robust and accurate system for early skin cancer
                diagnosis, enhancing the chances of successful treatment.
